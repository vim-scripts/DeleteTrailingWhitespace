DESCRIPTION				*DeleteTrailingWhitespace-description*

This plugin deletes whitespace at the end of each line, on demand via the
:DeleteTrailingWhitespace command, or automatically when the buffer is
written.

SEE ALSO								     *

This plugin leverages the superior detection and customization facilities of
the companion |ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim| plugin (vimscript #3966), though it
can also be used without it if you're not interested in highlighting and
customizing.

To quickly locate the occurrences of trailing whitespace, you can use the
companion |JumpToTrailingWhitespace.vim| plugin (vimscript #3968).

RELATED WORKS								     *

The basic substitution commands as well as more elaborate scriptlets, as the
idea of automating this can be found in this VimTip:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Remove_unwanted_spaces
There are already a number of plugins that define such a command; most bundle
this functionality together with the highlighting of trailing whitespace.
However, most of them cannot consider whitespace exceptions and are not as
flexible.
- trailing-whitespace (vimscript #3201) defines :FixWhitespace.
- bad-whitespace (vimscript #3735) defines :EraseBadWhitespace.
- Trailer Trash (vimscript #3938) defines :Trim.
- StripWhiteSpaces (vimscript #4016) defines :StripWhiteSpaces and strips
  automatically, too, but is way more simple than this plugin.
- WhiteWash (vimscript #3920) provides functions that also can strip visible
  ^M and sequential whitespacw between words.

USAGE					      *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-usage*
						   *:DeleteTrailingWhitespace*
:[range]DeleteTrailingWhitespace
			Delete all trailing whitespace in the current buffer
			or [range].

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION			       *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim DeleteTrailingWhitespace*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES			       *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- The |ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim| plugin (vimscript #3966) complements this
  script, but is not required. With it, this plugin considers the whitespace
  exceptions for certain filetypes.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			      *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					   *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-mappings*
This plugin doesn't come with predefined mappings, but if you want some, you
can trivially define them yourself: >
    nnoremap <Leader>d$ :<C-u>%DeleteTrailingWhitespace<CR>
    vnoremap <Leader>d$ :DeleteTrailingWhitespace<CR>
<
						  *g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace*
By default, trailing whitespace is processed before writing the buffer when it
has been detected and is currently being highlighted by the
|ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim| plugin.
To turn off the automatic deletion of trailing whitespace, use: >
    let g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace = 0
If you want to eradicate all trailing whitespace all the time, use: >
    let g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace = 1
<
					   *g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action*
For processing, the default action is aborting the write, unless ! is given.
To automatically eradicate the trailing whitespace, use: >
    let g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action = 'delete'
To ask whether to remove or keep the whitespace (either for the current
buffer, or all buffers in the entire Vim session), use: >
    let g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action = 'ask'
<
			*g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_ChoiceAffectsHighlighting*
When the plugin is configured to ask the user, and she answers the query with
"Never" or "Nowhere", the |ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim| highlighting is turned
off automatically; when you ignore it, there's typically no sense in still
highlighting it. If you don't want that, turn it off via: >
    let g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_ChoiceAffectsHighlighting = 0
<

	      *b:DeleteTrailingWhitespace* *b:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action*
The global detection and processing behavior can be changed for individual
buffers by setting the corresponding buffer-local variables.

HISTORY					    *DeleteTrailingWhitespace-history*

1.06	24-Feb-2015
- FIX: Warning for nomodifiable buffer does not consider buffer-local
  b:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action (after version 1.05).

1.05	12-Dec-2014
- Corner case: Avoid "E21: Cannot make changes, 'modifiable' is off" on a
  nomodifiable buffer when g:DeleteTrailingWhitespace_Action = 'delete', and
  instead just show a warning. Thanks to Enno Nagel for raising this issue.

1.04	14-Dec-2013
- Minor: Make substitute() robust against 'ignorecase'.
- Minor: Correct lnum for no-modifiable buffer check.
- Handle local exception regular expressions that contain a "/" character.
  This must be escaped for the :substitute/ command.

1.03	19-Apr-2012
Handle readonly and nomodifiable buffers by printing just the warning / error,
without the multi-line function error.

1.02	14-Apr-2012
FIX: Avoid polluting search history.

1.01	04-Apr-2012
Define command with -bar so that it can be chained.

1.00	16-Mar-2012
First published version.

0.01	05-Mar-2012
Started development.
